# F2PY_NS_2D
A python code for 2D Incompressible flow interfaced with Fortran through f2py
Has multiple options for data-driven closures - Maulik et al., J. Fluid Mech. 2018

Poisson solver - Spectrally accurate

"sh CleanandRun.sh" in terminal for visualizing solution and time taken

May need modification of CleanandRun.sh according to Python version (this example uses 3.6 for 64 bit arch),
compiler for Fortran is gfortran
